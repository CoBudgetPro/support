## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I add a new transaction?
To add a new transaction, go to the 'Expense' or 'Income' tab and tap the '+' button. Alternatively, you can use the '+' buttons on the main screen for Income and Expense.

### Can I edit an existing transaction?
You can edit any non-repeating transaction directly from the transaction list. However, editing the repeating portion of a transaction is not allowed and is disabled by design.

*Note:* To modify a repeating transaction, you must delete all occurrences of that transaction and create a new repeating transaction.

### Can I add custom categories?
Yes, you can create custom categories in addition to the default categories provided.

To add new categories, navigate to:
- **Settings -> Categories -> Income Categories** and add a new category.
- **Settings -> Categories -> Expense Categories** and add a new category.

Alternatively, you can add a new custom category while selecting a category when starting a new transaction.

### Can I edit a category name?
Currently, it is not possible to edit category names. This functionality will be available in future updates.

### Can I delete a transaction?
Yes, both individual and recurring transactions can be deleted. For recurring transactions, you can choose to delete a single occurrence or all transactions in the series.

### Can I delete a category?
Yes, you can delete any category you've added.

*Note:* Default categories that are preloaded with the app cannot be deleted.

### What is a repeating transaction?
A repeating transaction is set to automatically repeat at specified intervals, eliminating the need to enter the same transaction multiple times.

*Note:* If an 'End Date' is not specified, repeating transactions will continue for five years from the current date.

### Where is my data stored?
